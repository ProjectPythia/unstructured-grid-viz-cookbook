    "\n",
    "This notebook explores techniques for working with high-resolution unstructured grids, building upon the foundational concepts previously covered. While earlier examples focused on coarse-resolution grids to introduce core principles, many real-world applications require handling more detailed grid structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we utilize output from the 30km MPAS Atmosphere model, representing a significant increase in resolution compared to our previous examples. While this resolution allows us to effectively illustrate key visualization concepts, it's important to note that atmospheric and climate models often employ even higher resolutions. The concepts covered in this notebook are applicable to these higher resolutions. "

This caching mechanism ensures that follow-up polygon plots render substantially faster, making the initial processing time a worthwhile trade-off for improved ongoing performance.

However, as grid resolution increases, this visualization method becomes increasingly advantageous, delivering superior rendering performance compared to polygon-based approaches while maintaining high visual quality.\n",

    "The visualization output exhibits missing values, denoted as `NaN` in the resulting display. Additionally, unprojected visualizations reveal an inherent characteristic of global coordinate systems: point density increases notably near the equator relative to the poles. This creates a distinctive variation in visual densityâ€”an expected artifact when representing spherical data in a planar format.\n",

    "###  Optimizing Point Distribution Using Map Projections\n",

Map projections help normalize the spatial distribution of data points, substantially reducing the clustering effects observed in standard latitude-longitude visualizations.\n",

    "For example, an Orthographic projection provides one effective approach, though various other projections can also help. While projections address many distribution challenges, some missing values may persist in the output. However, these remaining gaps typically represent a considerable improvement over unprojected versions, where equatorial clustering creates more pronounced visualization artifacts."

    "### Controlling Resolution & Binning\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pixel_ratio` parameter provides precise control over the rasterization process by determining the size of individual raster pixels in your visualization. This parameter directly influences both the visual resolution and the data aggregation characteristics of your plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify a larger pixel ratio, the visualization creates smaller raster pixels. This higher-resolution approach means fewer data points are aggregated within each pixel, potentially leading to gaps in the visualization where pixels contain no data points. These empty pixels appear as `NaN` values in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, setting a smaller pixel ratio creates larger pixels that capture and aggregate more data points. This approach typically produces a more continuous visualization by reducing the likelihood of empty pixels, though it may sacrifice some fine detail in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel ratio effectively serves as a resolution control mechanism, allowing you to balance between granular detail and visual continuity based on your specific visualization requirements. This flexibility becomes particularly valuable when working with datasets of varying densities or when focusing on specific geographic regions that require different levels of detail."
