    "The “U” in UXarray stands for “Unstructured Grids”. UXarray extends upon and inherits from [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) for providing the Earth system sciences community with analysis and visualization functionality that can operate directly on the native unstructured mesh data resulting from climate and global weather models and observations.\n",

    "* ``UxDataset`` inherits from the ``xarray.Dataset`` class, providing much of the same functionality but extended to operate on Unstructured Grids through new and overloaded methods. Each ``UxDataset`` is linked to its own ``Grid`` object through the use of a class property (``UxDataset.uxgrid``) to provide a grid-aware implementation. An instance of ``UxDataset`` can be thought of as a collection of data variables, i.e. ``UxDataArray`` objects, that reside on a particular Unstructured Grid as defined in the ``uxgrid`` property.\n",

    "* ``UxDataArray`` similarly inherits from the ``xarray.DataArray`` class, providing single data variable-level functionality to operate on Unstructured Grids through new and overloaded methods. Similar to ``UxDataset``, it has a link to its own ``Grid`` object (``UxDataArray.uxgrid``). For isntance, if several ``UxDataArray`` variables exist in an ``UxDataset`` object, each of them will have a link to the same ``Grid`` object that proves all of them reside on the same unstructured grid topology."
