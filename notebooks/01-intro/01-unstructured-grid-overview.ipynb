    "Given the number of points in longitude and latitude direction, the code uses Numpy's meshgrid to generates a structured grid. The temperature data is then interpolated onto this grid, creating a smooth representation. Xarray is leveraged to organize the gridded data into a dataset, facilitating easy manipulation and visualization. The resulting plot showcases the data on this structure mesh, providing a clearer understanding of temperature variations across defined longitude and latitude ranges. Plotting the structured grid and the temperature data is done using Cartopy, a cartographic plotting library. \n",
