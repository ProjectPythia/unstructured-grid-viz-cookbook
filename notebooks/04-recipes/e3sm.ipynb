    "\n",
    "This recipe demonstrates how to analyze unstructured grid output from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) using UXarray. Unlike traditional approaches that require regridding, UXarray enables direct analysis of the native model output, preserving the full fidelity of the simulation data.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe guides you through calculating and visualizing key atmospheric radiation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shortwave Cloud Radiative Effect (SWCRE)\n",
    "2. Longwave Cloud Radiative Effect (LWCRE)\n",
    "3. Net Cloud Radiative Effect (NetCRE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow includes techniques for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computing radiation components directly on the native unstructured grid\n",
    "- Visualizing spatial patterns between two time steps\n",
    "- Analyzing temporal evolution through difference plots\n",
